prompts:
  talking: >
    Confident, warm, and relaxed demeanor. Occasional natural hand
    gestures to emphasise speech — right hand rises to chest height
    then returns to hip. Subtle weight shift side to side. Soccer ball
    remains still under right foot throughout. Engaged eye contact
    with camera. Expressive micro-expressions matching audio tone.
    Static full-body portrait shot, black background, soft warm light.

  listening: >
    Attentive and thoughtful expression, mouth closed. Slow nodding
    twice as if absorbing what is being said. Faint warm smile forms
    gradually. Left hand shifts slightly then settles at hip. Subtle
    forward lean of interest then eases back. Soccer ball stays still
    under right foot. Eyes focused and calm, occasional slow blink.
    Static full-body portrait shot, black background, soft warm light.
